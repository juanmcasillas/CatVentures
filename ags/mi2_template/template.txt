SCUMM template by Proskrito (MI2 styled) v2.0c

AGS v2.61 or later needed

**Read the DOC file included in the ZIP!** (MS Word file, sorry :/ )

By now the template comes in the form of a REALLY CRAPPY game, just some things 
i put there for testing reasons, and give an example of how the template works. 
This is because i think things will be explained better with examples rather 
than with my crappy english.
